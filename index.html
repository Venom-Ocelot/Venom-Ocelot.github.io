<h1>Diamond Dogs (MC)</h1>
<p>The Diamond Dogs are a private military company led by Big Boss. It was created as a result of the devastation of the Militaires Sans Fronti√®res as well as the attack on Mother Base. The name stems from the group's profession as "dogs of war," who were willing to carry out unsavory jobs for clients, while at the same time maintaining pride in their work. Owing to their name, they carry diamonds into battle and collect raw diamonds for the funding of their Mother Base. Besides engaging in combat and various mercenary jobs, the Diamond Dogs also retrieve various animals for an environmental NGO.
